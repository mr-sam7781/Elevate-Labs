# Nmap Lab Checklist (Printable)

- [ ] I will only scan systems I own / have permission for.
- [ ] I have noted the IP range / host IPs to use.
- [ ] I will run non-intrusive commands first (ping / top-ports).
- [ ] I will not run aggressive/vuln scripts on third-party systems.
- [ ] I will save outputs (`-oN` or `-oA`) for documentation.
- [ ] If using Wireshark, I will capture with a filter and avoid production networks.
- [ ] I will document findings in `report_template.md`.
